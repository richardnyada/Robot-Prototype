This is just an excercise (work in Progress) using Command Pattern to create a list of commands that can control the spider Object on a 
defined wall size.
L - Turn Left
F - Move Forward
U - Turn Up
D - Turn Down

There is also a console app that can be used to test the solution and a unit Test Project.
